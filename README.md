# odin-etch-a-sketch
[Live Preview](https://norphel.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/)

In this project I built a simple etch-a-sketch with following functionalities:
- draw (only black color option available as of now)
- erase
- random color
- clear the sketch area and resize

Following concepts from previous chapters of the course greatly helped in building this mini-project
- basic DOM manipulation such as selecting element nodes, creating nodes, appending, adding styles, callback functions, event objects
- CSS flexbox
